        <h3>Our Breads</h3>
        <p>
          Made from local organic flour the Indigo Sourdough is a full flavoured, hearty, traditional sourdough baked on the hearth of the oven to produce a nice crusty loaf.
           Great eaten fresh for 1-2 days and lovely toasted for up to a week. The ingredients that are being used are Organic white flour, organic indigo leaven, filtered water, salt.

        <h3>Pizzas</h3>
        <p>
          Dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, 
          mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, 
          in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.

        <h3>Mollasses Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          These cookies can be considered gingerbread cookies, and originally were named as such. They resemble the molasses cookies made by Archway; 
          they use relatively little ginger and are thus not as spicy hot as gingerbread cookies from many other recipes. They are usually somewhat soft and not at all gooey, 
          being halfway between crumbly and chewy.

        <h3>Chocolate Pie</h3>
        <p>
          A true diner classic, Chocolate Cream Pie is a head-turning treat, and just the thing for lovers of both chocolate and pie. The crust is prebaked, 
          then filled with a cooked, cooled chocolate filling. Topped with lightly sweetened whipped cream, it's the perfect combination of crispy crust, 
          dense chocolate-y filling, and ethereal cream garnish.

        <h3>Croissants</h3>
        <p>A croissant is a laminated, yeast-leavened bakery product that contains dough/roll-in fat layers to create a flaky, crispy texture. 
          Croissants belong to the Viennoiserie or pastry category of baked goods along with brioche, Danish and puff pastries. 
          A croissant usually contains normal levels of salt, yeast and sugar</p>

        <h3>Sweet Buns</h3>
        <p>
          sweet bun refers to any of a number of sweet, baked, yeast-leavened breakfast or dessert foods. They may contain spices, nuts, candied fruits, etc., 
          and are often glazed or topped with icing. Compared to regular bread dough, sweet roll dough generally has higher levels of sugar, fat, eggs, and yeast.
          They are often round and small.

    <p>WEEBLY'S BAKERY has been in the baking business since 1992 providing small town's bakery expeditions for 20 years. 
      We keep our store small to minimize our impact on the areas that are far from us and to ensure the other local bakery stores are not stressed or overwhelmed. 
      Our store is a tight knit group of expert Chefs in the field of baking. All of our employees are passionate about creating and serving. 
      We are all professional bakers and experts at pastries, so we can give you lots of information, and believe me, we have a lot to share.

        <h4>Mary</h4>
        <p>Weebly's was great to work with. We had a problem with a prominent bakery in Monroeville and called her that day and she said she would make time to meet with us that very day. 
          She took so much time with my daughter and her fiancee as well as the parents of the bride and groom. We were so happy.

          Never disappointed when I stop at Weebly's. We’ve got birthday cakes, cupcakes, cookies, pepperoni rolls and novelty cakes there over the years, it’s all fresh and delicious. 
          The employees are friendly and helpful and the prices are very reasonable.
          Cold brew fans, Patti’s is the best around

        <p>I have been to other bakeries, and this is the best. It’s comfortable here. The customer service is outstanding. Plus, they support the community. 
          They are good people. They make you feel like family. I included the tag off the box in everyone’s tray, so that they, too, would know just where I got these amazing cookies. <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>

        <p>I placed a very large assorted Christmas cookie order for this Christmas, and I can honestly say, the cookies were the BEST cookies 
          I have ever had in my life. I made up cookie trays for the members of my family as part of their Christmas gifts. Thank you guys for making me so proud to give your pastries!

        <h4>Susan</h4>
        <p>We initially chose Weebly's due to the location. It was very close to our wedding venue. From the initial contact to the delivery, everything was impressively great. 
          We chose 2 different layers/flavors: almond raspberry & strawberry champagne. They are amazing and inexpensive!

        <h4>Ben</h4>
        <p>We had Weebly's provide our wedding cake and several types of cookies for our recent wedding. Weebly's has been our go-to bakery for years– 
          and we would not trust anyone else to make our cake! Their items are always fresh and the icing is not the overly sweet kind you may find at some places.
